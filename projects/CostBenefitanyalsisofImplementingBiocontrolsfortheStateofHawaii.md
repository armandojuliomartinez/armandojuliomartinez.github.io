This research paper looks into three bio-controls for the state of Hawai'i and to show if these bio controls are worth implementing. The three bio-controls the state of Hawai'i is looking to implement are P. Coffea, A. Nitens, Galtara extensa (Fireweed moth). The research team does this by anaylizing the benefits and costs associated with implementing the bio-controls.
