## Invoice 1 WOD

The last WOD we performed in this class was to make a sample of a receipt for a purchase order. We did this by using expressions & variables in JavaScript. It was setup by using simple tables in html and document.writes along with script string templates and assigning variables with let to complete this WOD. If you want a more in depth description of the WOD and what was expected of us click here : [Invoice 1](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html).
