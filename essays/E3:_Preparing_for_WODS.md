## Invoice 1 WOD

The last WOD we performed in this class was to make a sample of a receipt for a purchase order. We did this by using expressions & variables in JavaScript. It was setup by using simple tables in html and document.writes along with script string templates and assigning variables with let to complete this WOD. If you want a more in depth description of the WOD and what was expected of us click here : [Invoice 1](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html). One struggle I had durring this lab was writting some of the document.write functions because I wrote my let variables in a seperate javascript file so I didn't have to worry about having a lot of Javascript in my html and I could later refer to parts of my javascript incase anything went wrong. Like other WOD's before I decided to RTFM on certain things. One of the things I read up on, was how to link a javascript file to an HTMl. One thing Which I did differently in this WOD was to set up a type of prep file for the WOD and it was just formatting for the table because I didn't enjoy the look of the table if I just kept it like a raw table which is what you get when you inspect the [Invoice 1](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html). What I might try and do for the next WOD is to have two different Screens for editing my VS code which would make bringing my let variables over into the document.writes much easier and I might implement a loop for this document.write which would be pretty interesting to implement.
