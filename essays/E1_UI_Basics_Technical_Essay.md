##Summary
The Browser History series of workshops provided a progressive journey into webpage development. Browser History 1 introduced an easy way to set up a web page through HTML using vs code. Browser History 2, builds on Browser Hist. 1, taught us how to use cascading style sheets to apply different fonts, change the background color, resize images and their positions. Browser Hist. 3 builds off of the previous two Browser Histories and combines both html and css to rearrange the layout of the webpage by adding a horizontal navigation bar and dividing the content into 3 separate columns.


## WOD 1
WOD 1: Sd - 23 mins
This WOD took me 2 attempts. I used a Doc Emmet to start off  the WOD. This saved me an immense amount of time on typing out all of the basic html tags to make a web page. I highly recommend using chatgpt as a research tool even if it is to remember certain HTML tags. If you use chatgpt I would recommend taking notes on the code it gives you that way you learn how to properly use the tags. I also recommend helping people with their WOD or getting help from others when you are trying it out first. Then I would go to the screencast. I also recommend attempting the first WOD before the day it is due. That way you are not freaking out while you are frantically trying to complete it under the recommended time.

## WOD 2

This WOD was the easiest of the three for me. What I like to do for my WODs is to play around with the file and the tags before recording. This way I can see how it displays and fix any mistakes before recording the video. Working with CSS was fairly intuitive; the only hard part of this lab was finding the url to the Oswald font. I would recommend doing a google search on how to add the Oswald font to your css. I ended up writing the process of finding the url on a separate sheet of paper.

## WOD 3

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.
