## About me

Hi I'm Armando! I am a senior and I am currently a BBA Candidate for Accounting and hope to be adding Management Information Systems to my degree. I am from a small city in California called Concord. Some of my hobbies include hiking, swimming, water polo, & learning new and interesting things. I know a lot of random factiods. One of my favorite ones being that a saguaro catci grow their first arm at 75 years old! 

## Professional Goals
