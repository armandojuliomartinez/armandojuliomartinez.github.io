## Assignment 2
Assignment 2 involved significant upgrades to our initial store design from Assignment 1, with the addition of new features such as login creation, registration, and logout routes. For detailed information on Assignment 2, you can visit [this link](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/). Through this assignment, I deepened my understanding of data transfer between the server and user_data.json, which enabled me to craft a personalized invoice page. My contributions accounted for about 50% of the project, while assistance from ChatGPT 50% respectively. ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable resource, even aiding in the implementation of my IR4.

This assignment presented far more routing complexities than the previous one. I spent the majority of my time—about 60%—conceptualizing solutions, complemented by 10% coding and 30% dedicated to testing and debugging. A successful strategy was taking the time to thoroughly understand each task and using the console to identify minor errors. One challenge was relying on ChatGPT for specific issues, which sometimes led to inefficiencies. In retrospect, a more effective approach would have been to clearly define problems before experimenting with solutions, rather than hastily rewriting code.
