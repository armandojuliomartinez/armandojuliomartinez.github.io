Hi everyone! My name is Armando, I am a third year, senior, who is majoring in Accounting and Management Information Systems (M.I.S.). I am from a small city in California called Concord. I currently work two jobs. One them being with the University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization as an undergraduate research assistant. I am currently helping two researchers conduct a cost benefit anaylsis of implementing three bio-controls for the state. My other job is working at the Duke Kahanamoku Aquatic Complex. Here I help set up for water polo games, swim meets and other fun events! Some of my hobbies include hiking, swimming, water polo, & learning new and interesting things. I know a lot of random factiods. One of my favorite ones being that a saguaro catci grow their first arm at 75 years old!
